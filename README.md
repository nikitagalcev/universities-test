# Intent

### Installation

1. Install dependencies using `yarn`.
2. Run `yarn install:pods` to install Pods.
3. Use `yarn dev` to run the Metro bundler.
4. Run the proxy server with `yarn proxy`.
5. Use `yarn start:ios` or `yarn start:android` to build and run the app in the development mode.

### Requirements

In this project you'll be using `University Domains API` (don't forget to run the proxy server).
The API includes names and countries of most of the universities of the world.

> http://localhost:9000/search?country=Poland
> http://localhost:9000/search?country=Poland&name=medical

You'll be implementing a simple app that contains 2 screens:

**Screen 1**

- the initial screen should contain a list of 5 countries: Poland, Germany, France, Spain, and the United Kingdom
- pressing the country card should open the `Screen 2` for that specific country.

**Screen 2**

- add a name of the country in the header
- the screen should contain a list of the country universities
- the screen should contain a search bar (there should be a possibility to filter the list by name)
- there should be an option to sort the list by name as well
- please display an empty state (placeholder) if there are no results
- each university card should contain the name and pressable link which opens the university web page in the default phone browser

### Other

- if you don't want to use TS in this project change the `allowJs` param to `true` in `./tsconfig.json` (or completely remove TS from the project dependencies)
- estimated time to complete this task is 4h but we don't use a stopwatch! :)

Good luck! ðŸ¤—
